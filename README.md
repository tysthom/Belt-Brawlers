# Belt-Brawlers

This is Belt Brawlers! A 3D fighting game inspired by multiple different survival games with a karate theme.
This year-long project combines my skills of 3D modeling, animating, and programming into one game.
Created in the Unity Engine with C#, with 3D modeled assets and animations designed in Blender.
Works best with a controller.

Enjoy!!
